The project was to set up a recipe website that had a main page that would 
link to 3 sub pages that contained the recipes. Using the html tags I have learned
over the last few days I was able to put together the website with lists and links throughout.
I am very happened with out it turned out considering I am a complete beginner,
and I look forward to looking at this one day to see how far I have come.
