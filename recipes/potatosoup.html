    <p><h2>A delicious potato soup that is both easy to make, and easy on the pocketbook.</h2></p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 strips uncooked bacon chopped into small peices</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 lbs gold potatoes (peeled and diced)</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cups of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon ancho chili powder</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sour cream </li>
            <li>Shredded cheese, chives, and additional sour cream and bacon for topping</li>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bacon peices in a large dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook bacon until crisp and browned.</li>
            <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving fat in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add butter and chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion are tender.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook till fragrant.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth</li>
            <li>Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. Stir well</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half*** of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, but just eyeballing the amount will be fine. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender.).</li>
            <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour cream and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.</li>
            <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Top with additional sour cream, bacon, cheddar cheese, or chives. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
